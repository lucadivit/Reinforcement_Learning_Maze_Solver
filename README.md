# Reinforcement_Learning_Maze_Solver
This github contains a simple OpenAi Gym Maze Enviroment and (at now) a RL Algorithm to solve it.

## General Info
At now i implemented only the Q-Learning tabular algorithm, only epsilon greedy policy with (optional) epsilon decay, and a maze enviroment with OpenAI Gym template.
